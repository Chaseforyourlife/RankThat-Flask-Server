# RankThat-Flask-Server
Full Stack server hosted by a flask api, 250 hours invested

The RankThat application runs on a flask api with base HTML, CSS, and javascript rendering the frontend. The app has a full admin panel to control users on the site, 
rankable categories, and contents of every category. The database uses SQLAlchemy in a .db file on the server. 

I had always wanted to understand how servers communicated with the frontend of computers. I decided to take on this project and learn how to use HTML, CSS, flask, 
and javascript. I ended up fully hosting this server on a registered domain name, but took it down because it was costly to keep up. The skills I gained on this project
have been extremely useful. While researching under Dr. Das, I was able to set up a server that collected the images uploaded by a raspberry pi. Additionally, during 
my first few weeks at my Co-op with Hunter Engineering, I was able to majorly improve on the image annotation process by setting up a React GUI hosted by a flask api,
which saves the company a huge amount of time and lowers the teaching time to put someone new on the project.
